<h1 align="center">Project JuicyBoys (name TBD)</h1>

## Motivation (TODO)
This project is being created to tackle one of Africa's biggest challenges: bringing the spotlight to market-creating innovations which were created using technology.
The application is designed to spread knowledge, build a community, and encourage discussion revolving around a diverse range of topics. 
It solves the problem of not having a single platform that ties e-learning and community building into one.
The motivation behind creating this project is to create a simple way for people to spread their knowledge, digitally showcase their startup, or find a way to learn something new.
