## Task Breakdown

Task breakdown can be seen on JIRA but half the group was split into frontend and the other half into backend. This was done to fit every team member's strengths.

## Sprint Decisions

Last sprint we implemented fully functioning courses for students and teachers. The stories that were worked on during this sprint mimicked the functionalities of last sprint, but for companies instead of courses.
