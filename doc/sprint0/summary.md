# Summary!

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an e-learning platform that values community, knowledge, and discussion. The web-app will allow instructors to create courses, students to enrol in courses, organizations to create company-related content. Discussion and conversation will be encouraged throughout the app, enabling users to ask questions and strengthen their knowledge of course topics. Virtual events, video conferencing, and online course assessments will be supported to create an authentic learning experience.

## Key Users
- Students (e.g. 19-year old student at UofT who wants to learn React)
- Course Instructors (e.g. 35-year old engineer at Google who wants to create and publish a course on React)
- Organizations/Companies (e.g. a new startup that wants to upload company values, etc.)

## Key Scenarios
- John, a 35-year old Software Engineer at Google wants to spread his knowledge and create an introductory course for Web Development. He needs a platform to showcase his course materials including lecture videos, short quizzes, and other course content.
- Paula, a 19-year old Computer Science student is seeking her first internship. She notices most companies ask for experience with React, while she has none. Paula needs a platform from which she can become an expert at React and build her own side projects to impress employers!
- Timmy, a 27-year old startup founder, wants a way to easily onboard new engineers at his startup. He needs a platform which hosts tutorials for the tech used and a way to digitally showcase the company's values/ideologies. 

## Key Principles
1. **Fast Performance**
	- Every large web-app needs to have good performance else users will never visit again.
	- Need to value database optimization, code efficiency, and good software design choices.
2. **Highly Responsive**
	- The project should be responsive on all types of devices.
	- App layout should be organized and consistent on mobile, tablet, PC, ...
3. **Attractive UI**
	- UI is very important as that is what the user always interacts with. 
	- UI should be similar on both instructor and student versions of the web-app.
