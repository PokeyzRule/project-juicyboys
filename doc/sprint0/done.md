# Done...

What exactly does it mean to be done? By definition, if something is done or you are done with it, it is either finished or you have finished doing. For our team at JuicyBoys, the definition of done is no different. Martin Luther King Jr. once said: â€œI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed". Much like Martin Luther King Jr, our team at JuicyBoys also has a dream, a dream, and a vision of a final product and the definition of "done" directly corresponds to the achievement of this vision. Unfortunately, achieving our final product is not a one-step process and various smaller components also need to be "done". Together, we have categorized these smaller components into two main categories, the User Interface, and the Features/Functionalities.

## What does done mean for the User Interface that we will implement?

In the early days of our beloved computing machine, all we had was a command line that took commands from users to perform specific tasks and interact with the computer, typically used by programmers. Nowadays we have multiple operating systems with their dedicated graphical interface that can be used to perform the same tasks as the command line. Why the huge change in how we interact with our computers? This is mainly because not everyone knows how to use the command line. A graphical interface gives users a visual representation of the things they are interacting with, while the same information is portrayed in the form of text on the command line. This emergence of the graphical interface is an example of User Interface Design. 

A User Interface Design connects users to an application. User Interface Design is important because it provides us with the means to increase and maximize the usage of our application which in turn gives our application a better meaning behind it. As developers, we would like our final product to be used by various types of people, and for such reasons, we must take usability of our User Interface as a factor.

To do this, we will be following the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ben/goldenrules.html">8 golden rules of User Interface</a>. These rules are taken from the text Designing the User Interface by Ben Shneiderman. Shneiderman is said to have derived these rules from experience and applicable in the majority of interactive systems after being properly refined, extended, and interpreted.

The 8 Golden Rules of User Interface:

- Strive for consistency
- Seek universal usability
- Offer informative feedback
- Design dialogs to yield closure
- Prevent errors
- Permit easy reversal of actions
- Keep users in control
- Reduce short-term memory load

In conclusion, our team at JuicyBoys has agreed that for our User Interface Design or components of our User Interface Design to be considered "done", this means that these components do not violate the 8 golden rules of User Interface.

## What does done mean for the Features/Functionalities that we will implement?

Features and Functionalities are important for an application because it gives the application meaning and a cause, it gives users reasons to use our application. For this very reason, our team at JucyBoys has decided to special attention towards the features of our application. 

For our Features to be considered "done", we must ensure the following key principles:

1. **Code is organized and readable**
      - Code gets messy working in large groups, code should be clean and  consistent for others  
            to read.
      - Code should be organized so important components are easily accessable
      - Fllowing best practices for variable, function, and class names
      - Doc strings, function headers, in line comments should be used for documantation
2. **No errors in the feature**
      - Features should be tested throughly and ensure no errors are caused
      - Features are the building blocks of the product, errorless building  blocks minimize errors  
            on entire application
4. **Features clearly match the requirements set by the user story**
      - Features must clearly solve the problem the user is facing in the user story
      - All CoS are satisfied
5. **Fast Performance**
	- Every large web-app needs to have good performance else users  will never visit again.
	- Need to value database optimization, code efficiency, and good  software design choices.
6. **Highly Responsive**
	- The project should be responsive on all types of devices.
	- App layout should be organized and consistent on mobile, tablet, PC, ...
	- Software passes all integration tests on all major OS such as Windows, MacOS, Linux.
