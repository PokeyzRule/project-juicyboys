# Process
We formally formed our group when we merged 2 groups together to make up a team of seven. A group of 5 who wanted two more students with frontend experience and another group of two students with frontend experience who wanted students with goals of reaching a similar mark. We were a great match and merged the two groups as we contacted each other on discord. The moment that we all gathered in our newly created discord group we all greeted each other excitingly and professionally; this set the tone for our group and reflected throughout everything we did together. Interactions were respectful and professional; we were responsive with the group in discord and always showed interest when we talked with one and another.

When we had to make decisions like when we decided our group name: JuicyBois. We brainstormed ideas from everyone and compared the ideas as a group; Delving into the ideas making sure we explored the pros and cons, and what the consequences of each idea would mean. We encourage everyone to share their opinions which allows us to see potential roadblocks and the impact of the idea and making sure that everyone is heard. When we understood the pros/cons of each idea we voted for the one that most members agreed with.

To maximize our group communication and to make sure everyone understand what we need to do. We have decided to meet everyday (Workdays only) on discord as a scrum meeting. A meeting everyday at night where we are all free enables us to discuss what each members have done, what we need to do, distribute the workload, discuss about the project and possible roadblocks. For example in Sprint0, we met up in our daily meetings use the handouts we were given to decide what topic we should choose, since most of us agreed that e-learning & community was the more interesting and aligned with what we wanted to learn and do that became our topic. Discussion ensued about what we needed to finish for sprint0 and divided up workload for everyone to work towards during the week.

For our next phase, we hope to continue how we meet each other and discussions on discord. Better our organization to more specific chat like frontend, backend, resources, meeting notes and etc. on discord instead of putting everything in the general chat. This helps us organize our dissussion so that we aren't wasting people's time with irrelevant info.
### Roles
We have decided to split everyone into either Frontend or Backend developers. This doesn't mean that people from the frontend can't work on the backend and vice versa. It's just what the majority of our work will be within.
* Frontend
    * Zhiqi
    * Vignesh (Tester for Frontend)
    * Nevin
    * Keshavaa

* Backend
    * Ammar (Tester For Backend)
    * Gordon
    * Tanzim

Keshavaa will be the product owner, this means that he assigns tasks and are responsible for management of the various components of Jira; as well as checking to make sure customer's requirments are met by our team. While our TA is the Scrum Master.

### Prioritizing User Stories

Currently we have a very simple way of assigning priority to user stories. Currently the core features are denoted with "Most Important" in the product backlog followed by features that are necessary but not as integral to the application denoted with "Important". Finally there are features we wish to add denoted by "Not Criticai", since these features aren't tied to the usability of the application. A bigger breakdown of priority may be done in the future perhaps when stories are assigned in the sprints, but for now this system works to show what's a core story, important story, and a "nice to have" story.
