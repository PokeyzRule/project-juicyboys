## Task Breakdown

Task breakdown can be seen on JIRA but half the group was split into frontend and the other half into backend. This was done to fit every team member's strengths.

## Sprint Decisions

Last sprint we implemented basic functionalities that allowed the web application to become operational. This sprint we leveraged those features to create fully functioning courses for students and teachers. The stories that were worked on during this sprint allow teachers to upload material to courses, and students to interact in courses and submit work to be marked.
