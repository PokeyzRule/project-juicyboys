# Sprint 1

## Sprint goal

Complete basic frontend and backend functionality for teacher and student users. Users are able to create and login with an account, teachers are able to create courses which students can enroll in as well as upload various media types, and students are able to view their profile, courses, and enroll in potential classes.

## Taks Breakdown

Task breakdown can be seen on JIRA but half the group was split into frontend and the other half into backend. This was done to see team member's strong and weak points for future sprints and planning. Future sprints will now be planned keeping each team member's weaknesses and strenghts in mind to more effectively finish tasks and user stories.

## Sprint Decisions

The stories that were worked on during this sprint are the most basic yet fundamental stories that needed to be finished first before further features are implemented. This includes but isn't limited to establishing authentication, basic profile creation, security middlewares, course creation and enrolling students into those courses. Future stories will levereage implementations made in Sprint 1 which is why Sprint 1 was key for establishing db structure, project architecture and workflows.
