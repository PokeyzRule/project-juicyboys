# Release Planning Meeting

## Release goal

The initial release of this project should contain at least have all core features/user stories described in PB.md fully implemented. For student, teacher and entrepreneur users, all core features should be fully functional and implemented both in the front and backend. Future stories can also be integrated if time permits and continuous improvements to the UI will be made before the initial release. The goal of the release should not only be able to have core features function, but a pleasant UI to accompany it as well as 2 or 3 "nice to have" features.
